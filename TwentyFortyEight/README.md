# Python Clone for GAME 2048
> This is a python clone game challenge for '2048', details about the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)). My version of this games give players the opportunity to play on different kinds of grids that is Square or Rectangular. Building the game thought me a lot about working with grids in python and python conventions enforced with pylint. To play this game online, head to [CodeSkulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user307_biorjpH9nC_15.py) and run code. Also, you can also play game on your terminal by running the script.

## Features
* Can play on any type of grid 2 x 2, 2 x 4, 11 x 5, i x j
* Added testing of code with my [Simple Test Suite](https://github.com/devvspaces/python_projects/tree/master/Simple_test_suite)
* Can play game on terminal and online with a GUI


## Running the tests

To run tests on the code;

1. Make sure the Test Suite is properly added to python sys

```python
sys.path.append('C:/Users/Dell/python_projects')
```

That should be your directory to cloned or downloaded project


2. Uncomment `run_suite()` located at the bottom of code.py
